Moved the whole of Emacs Freex to be hosted on Google Code:

http://emacs-freex.googlecode.com

Until now, we'd been using Mercurial. It proved to be too much of a pain to import all the history, so I've uploaded a [tarball of the full Mercurial repository](http://emacs-freex.googlecode.com/files/freex-0.3.3-hg.tar.gz) when we created the Google Code repository (at the same time we released [0.3.3](http://emacs-freex.googlecode.com/files/freex-0.3.3.tar.gz)).


## 22nd October, 2007 ##

Added [Quickstart](Quickstart.md).

Uploaded [0.3.2](http://emacs-freex.googlecode.com/files/freex-0.3.2.tar.gz).


## 19th September 2007 ##

Added basic [Installation](Installation.md) instructions and [Tutorial](Tutorial.md).


## 16th September 2007 ##

We've just uploaded the first release version, [0.3.1](http://emacs-freex.googlecode.com/files/freex-0.3.1.tar.gz).
