We want to thank the [http://mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html Muse] developers, since huge chunks of their code provided the foundation for much of the Freex fontification and xml parsing.

We are hugely indebted to [http://pinard.progiciels-bpi.ca/wiki/showPage.yaws?node=home Francois Pinard] for creating and maintaining Pymacs, without which Freex wouldn't have been possible.

There are definitely other people we should thank - we'll add them here as we remember.
