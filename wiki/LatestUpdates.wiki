Moved the whole of Emacs Freex to be hosted on Google Code:

http://emacs-freex.googlecode.com

Until now, we'd been using Mercurial. It proved to be too much of a pain to import all the history, so I've uploaded a [http://emacs-freex.googlecode.com/files/freex-0.3.3-hg.tar.gz tarball of the full Mercurial repository when we created the Google Code repository (at the same time we released [http://emacs-freex.googlecode.com/files/freex-0.3.3.tar.gz 0.3.3]).
